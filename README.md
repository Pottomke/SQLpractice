# Project Codewars - 7 kyu in SQL

## Story

It cannot be stressed enough that you can learn to code only through practice.
There are numerous coding sites, but [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is one
of the best because of its huge community, good assignment descriptions, and
gamified progress support.

In this project we ask you to practice your SQL skills on Codewars and
get better!

## What are you going to learn?

- Practice basic SQL queries.
- Compose `SELECT` statements with filtering and ordering.
- Use basic operators and functions (such as `IN`, `NOT IN`, `MIN`,
  `MAX`, `SUM`, `%`, `SQRT`, `LOG`, `FLOOR`, `CEIL`, `LOWER`).

## Tasks

1. Reach 7 kyu in SQL on the Codewars coding platform by solving katas.
    - There is a screenshot of the Codewars profile page (`https://www.codewars.com/users/<username>`) named `screenshot.jpg` pushed into the repository which shows that _at least the required level in the required language_ is reached.

## General requirements

- An account is registered on the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) coding platform.

## Hints

- Try to solve 8 kyu katas first. You can see all of them
  [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/sql?q=&r%5B%5D=-8&tags=Databases).
- Train yourself by random katas by using the `Your next challange...` box
  on your [dashboard](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard). If you want to try
  harder katas, choose `Rank Up`, if you want to solidify your knowledge at a given
  level, choose `Practice and Repeat` from the drop-down list.

## Background materials

- None
